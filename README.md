# What Is Your Next AI Slop Project? 🤖💩

*Yet another AI-powered thing, because apparently we don't have enough of those...*

Welcome to the most self-aware project planner in existence! This is your one-stop shop for generating the next big AI project that will definitely revolutionize everything and totally not end up abandoned in your GitHub graveyard after two weeks.

## 🎪 Why This Exists

Look, we've all been there. You wake up at 3 AM with a "brilliant" idea for an AI app, spend 47 hours researching the perfect tech stack, then realize you have no idea what you're actually building. Well, fear not! This tool will help you professionally procrastinate by planning your project with beautiful, interactive diagrams that will make you feel productive while avoiding actual coding.

## ✨ Features (That You'll Probably Never Use)

- **🤖 AI-Powered Generation**: Because why think for yourself when you can ask ChatGPT's cousin to do it? Generate project templates faster than you can abandon them!
- **🎨 Visual Project Designer**: Drag and drop your way to productivity! It's like playing with LEGO, but for adults who refuse to admit they're just procrastinating
- **🚀 Real-time Streaming**: Watch your hopes and dreams generate in real-time! Now with 67% more buzzwords per second
- **📁 Multiple Project Types**: Support for React, Next.js, Vue, Node.js, and whatever framework will be dead by next Tuesday
- **🎛️ Dynamic Configuration**: Customize everything except your tendency to start new projects instead of finishing old ones
- **💾 Project Templates**: Save your configurations so you can feel organized while ignoring them completely
- **🔄 Real-time Collaboration**: Share your half-baked ideas with other developers who will also never build them
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Looks great on mobile, so you can plan projects while pretending to pay attention in meetings

## 🎭 What This Really Does

This tool helps you:
- ✅ Feel productive without actually being productive
- ✅ Generate impressive-looking project structures
- ✅ Procrastinate with style and sophistication  
- ✅ Create beautiful diagrams that nobody will ever look at again
- ✅ Add another "AI-powered" project to your portfolio
- ❌ Actually finish any projects (that's still on you, buddy)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (AKA The Usual Suspects)

*Because if you're not using the latest JavaScript framework, are you even a real developer?*

### Core Framework
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)** - Because regular React wasn't complicated enough
- **[React 18](https://react.dev)** - Now with 73% more hooks and 200% more confusion
- **[TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)** - For when you want to argue with your computer about types all day

### AI Integration (The Magic Sauce 🪄)
- **[Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai)** - Making AI integration so easy, even your cat could build a chatbot
- **Multiple AI Providers** - Because why commit to one AI overlord when you can serve them all?

### UI & Visualization (Making It Pretty)
- **[React Flow](https://reactflow.dev)** - For creating diagrams that look way more complex than your actual code
- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)** - Copy-paste components that make you look like a design genius
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** - Because writing actual CSS is apparently too mainstream
- **[Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion)** - Animations that will distract users from your bugs
- **[tsParticles](https://particles.js.org)** - Particles, because every app needs more particle effects, obviously

### Development Tools (The Necessary Evils)
- **[TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)** - Did we mention TypeScript? It bears repeating
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org)** - For when you need a robot to tell you your code sucks
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io)** - Because arguing about semicolons is so 2019

## 🚀 Getting Started (If You Dare)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project may cause:
- Excessive planning without execution
- An irresistible urge to create more AI-powered tools
- Temporary feelings of productivity
- Side effects may include: imposter syndrome, analysis paralysis, and an overwhelming desire to rewrite everything in Rust

## 🤝 Contributing

Got ideas for making this even more over-engineered? Pull requests welcome! Please ensure your contributions include:
- At least 3 new JavaScript frameworks
- A minimum of 47 configuration files
- Documentation that's longer than the actual code
- Existential crisis about whether we need another AI tool

*Built with ❤️, 🤖, and an unhealthy amount of ☕ by developers who clearly have too much time on their hands.*

**Remember**: This tool won't actually make you finish your projects, but at least you'll have pretty diagrams to show for it! 📊✨
