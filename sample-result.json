For the backend, adhere to serverless function best practices, such as keeping functions small and focused, using environment variables for configuration, and implementing proper logging and monitoring. Use linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier) to maintain code quality and consistency.",
    "security": "Use environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys and database credentials. Sanitize user inputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Implement authentication and authorization to protect user data. Follow OWASP guidelines for web application security. Use Helmet.js middleware in Next.js to set security-related HTTP headers. Consider using a password hashing library like bcrypt for storing user passwords (if user accounts are implemented).",
    "testing": "Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing frontend components. Use Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end testing to ensure the chatbot functions correctly in a browser environment. Implement integration tests for backend functions to verify that they interact correctly with the database and the AI model. Use a mocking library like Jest Mock to mock API calls and database interactions during testing.",
    "performance": "Frontend: Implement code splitting, lazy loading for images and components, and optimize images using tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG. Utilize a CDN for static assets. Backend: Optimize database queries, implement caching strategies (e.g., using Redis or Vercel's Edge Cache for frequently accessed data), and monitor function execution times to identify and address performance bottlenecks. Infrastructure: Leverage Vercel's global CDN and serverless infrastructure for automatic scaling and load balancing. Monitor application performance using Vercel's built-in analytics or third-party tools like Datadog.",
