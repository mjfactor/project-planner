## Theming & Design System

- **Do NOT edit or modify color values** - This project uses shadcn/ui theming system with comprehensive dark mode support
- Use existing CSS custom properties and Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`)
- The theming system is already configured in `globals.css` with proper light/dark mode variables
- Respect the established design tokens and color palette
- When styling components, use semantic color classes that work with both light and dark themes
- Avoid hardcoded color values or custom color modifications

## Frameworks
- **Next.js**: Use the latest stable version (currently v15) with App Router
- **React**: Use React 19 with concurrent features enabled
- **shadcn/ui**: Use the latest version for UI components
